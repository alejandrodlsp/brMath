# brMath
brMath is a lightweight, header-only C++ mathematical library. It is designed for 3D graphic libraries such as OpenGL.

It includes implementations for **Vectors** of size 2 and 3 based on the Unity's [API specification]. It also supports 4x4 **Matrices** with utilities to generate view and projecion matrices, and manipulate model matrices with transations, rotations and scaling.

It also provides a wrapper class to some basic mathematical operations.
